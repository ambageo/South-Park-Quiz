# South-Park-Quiz
This is the quiz app for the Project 3 of the EU Android for Beginners Scholarship in Udacity. 
The app consists of a 8- question quiz for one of my favorite shows, South Park.
The app has 3 questions requiring one right answer (implemented with the use of RadioButtons,
1 question requiring multiple answers to be chosen (implemented with checkBoxes)
and 3 questions where the user is required to type the answer (implemented with EditTexts).
The "show me the results" button calculates and shows a toast message with the result, 
while the "Noooo!!! Retake" button resets all answers and lets the user try from the beginning.
